# Variance Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of variance which allows us to compute the agreement between experts and in repeated measurements of a single expert for diferent procedures for measuring cumulus expansion.

## Project setup

To reproduce the results start by cloning the repo and change to the repo directory.

```
source bin/init-local.sh
cd src
python VarianceAnalysis-Pinguoin.py
```

The images of the paper will be recreated at the `figs` directory.
